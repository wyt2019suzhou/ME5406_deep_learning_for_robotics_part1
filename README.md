# deep_learning_for_robotics_part1
## This is the code for NUS 'ME5406 deep learning for robotics'project 1
This project implements three model free reinforcement learning algorithms: First-visit Monte Carlo control without exploring starts, SARSA with an ϵ-greedy behavior policy, Q-learning with an ϵ-greedy behavior policy in different frozen lake environments
